#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n), this is because the while loop runs O(n) and there is operation inside of this throughout which gives us 0(1)


b)


c)0(n). in that it begins with n and the value decreases by 1 until n reaches zero. Whenever the algorithm calls itself again the remaining number of loops decreases by 1.

## Exercise II

If the egg breaks on first drop, return where it was dropped at(floor). Start with the first floor. For each floor starting at base level(0) until we retun n, if egg breaks then return the which floor broke it. While egg is not broken is true continue, until egg breaks.  This runtime complexity of 0(n).
